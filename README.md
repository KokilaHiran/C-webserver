# Web Server

## Description
This is a simple web server implemented in C that serves static HTML files. It listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with the appropriate content based on the requested URL.

## Installation
To compile the server, ensure you have GCC installed. Run the following command in the Command Prompt:

```bash
gcc -o server.exe server.c

```

## Usage
To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
./server.exe
```

The server will start listening on port 8080. You can access the web pages by navigating to the following URLs in your web browser:

- `http://localhost:8080/` (index.html)
- `http://localhost:8080/about.html` (about.html)
- `http://localhost:8080/contact.html` (contact.html)
